# Data Analysis for Crime in San Francisco
**Data:** The San Francisco crime dataset covers incidents in 2016 and includes all categories of crime registered in the police department. 

This is an exploratory data analysis and uses data visualization tools, crosstabulation, and a thematic map to examine the crime distribution by districts of the San Francisco city. The analyis displays that the category of Larceny/Theft was the main problem of the city, while the district of Southern had the highest number of registered crime in the total and in the Larceny/Theft category as well. Similarly, the number of crime registery was also the highest in one neighborhood than others, which is clearly displayed below.

Furthermore, the analysis sheds light on the active periods of time in criminality. For instance, among days of week, Fridays used to be very actief than other days, while Sundays were calmer. And the distribution of crime reports over a day displays that time matters.
